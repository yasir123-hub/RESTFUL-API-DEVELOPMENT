#DESCRIPTION

As part of my internship project, I developed a RESTful API for a Library Management System using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The primary objective of this task was to design and implement a backend service capable of handling CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—for managing books within a library. Each book record includes essential details such as the title, author, ISBN, published date, and the number of available copies. The API exposes functional endpoints including `POST /api/books` to add new books, `GET /api/books` to retrieve all books, `GET /api/books/:id` to fetch details of a specific book, `PUT /api/books/:id` to update existing book information, and `DELETE /api/books/:id` to remove a book from the system. The Express.js framework was used to handle routing and HTTP requests, while Mongoose was used to define the schema and perform database operations in MongoDB. Environment variables were managed using a `.env` file to store the database connection string securely. All routes include proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes to ensure smooth client-server communication. The API follows RESTful principles and provides a clean, modular code structure by separating models and routes. This task helped me strengthen my understanding of backend development, API architecture, and integration with NoSQL databases. The final API is lightweight, maintainable, and easily testable using tools like Postman or Thunder Client, and can be deployed on platforms like Render or Railway.
